## GreenArrays: Overview ##

The C programming language is notoriously unsafe. As an example, it does not prevent out-of-bounds memory accesses. There exist several techniques to secure C programs. However, although effective, these methods tend to slow down the safe programs substantially. The GreenArrays project consists of a suite of static techniques - tainted flow analysis, integer overflow analysis, symbolic range analysis and region analysis to mitigate this overhead. These analyses are all implemented on Ferrante's dependence graph. The figure below illustrates the inter-play between the different static analyses.

GreenArrays is the first demonstration that some of these analyses can scale up to large programs, if carefully implemented. In the effort to implement GreenArrays, we had the opportunity to redesign some aspects of these classic algorithms. As an example, our range and region analyses use extensive live range splitting strategies to achieve precision while preserving efficiency. The concrete result of our toils is a theoretically sound framework which can be combined with C instrumentation libraries, and that is faster and more effective than previous algorithms designed to eliminate bound-checks. We validate our claims by incorporating our findings into the well-known <a href='http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer'>AddressSanitizer</a>. We generate SPEC CINT 2006 code that is 17% faster and 9% more energy efficient than the code produced originally.
