# Introduction #

Programs written in type unsafe languages such as C and C++ often suffer from memory errors caused by buffer overflows or dangling pointers. Such errors have mostly unknown semantics, and could go completely unnoticed by users and developers, while still having devastating side-effects. In this paper, we present ArAnot - a tool that will help developers reason about their pro- gramâ€™s memory safety through annotations, making bugs immediately visible; hence, significantly reducing the risk of runtime memory violations. Our tool is unique, because it combines three different static analysis techniques to infer the size of arrays, and the ranges of variables used to index these buffers. Armed with this information, it generates a copy of the input program augmented with series of annotations that tell the developers which array accesses are provably safe, and which ones might be unsafe.


# ArAnot #
Take the following C program:
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int *a = malloc(16 * sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i)
    a[i] = i;
  for (int i = 0; i < 17; ++i)
    a[i] = i;

  int *b = malloc(argc * sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < argc; ++i)
    b[i] = i;
  for (int i = 0; i < argc + 1; ++i)
    b[i] = i;

  return 0;
}
```
We run files through ArAnot using `./run_aranot.sh <FILE>`.
The output file is `aranot.<FILE>`.
Running the given program through ArAnot generates the following output:
```
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int *a = malloc(16 * sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i)
    a[i] = i;
  for (int i = 0; i < 17; ++i)
    /* bytes(&a[i]) = 0 * sizeof(int)   */
    /* index(&a[i]) = 0                 */
    /* WARNING: Possibly unsafe access. */
    /*          Off-by-one error.       */
    a[i] = i;

  int *b = malloc(argc * sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < argc; ++i)
    b[i] = i;
  for (int i = 0; i < argc + 1; ++i)
    /* bytes(&b[i]) = 0 * sizeof(int)   */
    /* index(&b[i]) = 0                 */
    /* WARNING: Possibly unsafe access. */
    /*          Off-by-one error.       */
    b[i] = i;

  return 0;
}
```

Notice that all unsafe accesses were annotated with comments providing information about the safety of given accesses.

## Statistics ##

Here, we show the run time for each part of our analysis for the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. We see that all three analyses usually take less than one second to execute and they always take less than ten. These times are usually at least an order of magnitude less than the total time of compilation.

In this chart, we show the number and percentage of memory accesses that our tool was able to infer as being safe. In total, 31% of memory accesses were proved to be safe for the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks.
